## Become a member

To join us, you have to

- **submit a membership to us** [by e-mail](@/contact/index.en.md) or on paper,
- **and pay a 15 euro subscription**
  - either by giving it to a member of the Board,
  - or by transferring it to the association bank account ([RIB available here](https://rib.sansnom.org)),
  - or by card [via helloasso](https://www.helloasso.com/associations/association-sans-nom/adhesions/adhesion-2020).

The Board then validate (subject to exception) the membership and you become
part of the association!

Example of a mail request for membership :

> Hello,
> 
> I would like to join Association Sans Nom and I agree to de respect [its
> status](@/status/index.en.md).
> 
> --
> Full name

Although some of the association activities are open to the public, we only
accept as members **people who are related to a 42 Network campus** (students,
alumni, staff…).

The subscription is **valid until the 31 January** of the year following the
subscription payment, or of the next year if it is paid during the two last
months of the year If it's not clear, you can look at [the documentation page
about membership and
subscription](@/activities/association/membership-and-subscription/index.en.md).
