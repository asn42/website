# Association Sans Nom services

> _RTFM_, fine, but where is the doc?

Here, you'll find documentation regarding our services and meetings to work on
them. We run our services in the spirit of Free Software. It means that in
addition to the source code, we'll try to give enough information and
documentation to allow you to run the same services yourself if you want.

Documenting now is the best way to avoid futur problems.

> The empty pages will be filled, and the others improved.</span>
