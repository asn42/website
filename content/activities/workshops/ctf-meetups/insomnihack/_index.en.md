## Insomni'Hack Teaser CTF

![First CTF meetup at 42](header_ctf_meetup_1_en.png)

Let's make a good start this year, with a proposition from [Association Sans
Nom](https://sansnom.org) to take a stab at computer security with an challenge
online : the [Teaser
<span title="Capture The Flag">CTF</span>](https://teaser.insomnihack.ch/) of
[Insomni'Hack](https://www.insomnihack.ch/), which **will start at 10:00 on
Saturday, January 18, and last 24 hours.**.

The idea is to get together in the cluster to help each other and share a good
time.
You can show up and leave when you want, although it's obviously more enjoyable
to start at the same time.

The only prerequisite is a craving for brain-teasers and some curiosity.
If it works for you, don't hesitate to join us in the first rows, right of E2.
