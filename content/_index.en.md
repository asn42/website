## Libre and security

There are common values shared by Free/Libre movements and security, which come
from hacking: studying how things work, improve them, find weaknesses to change
their purpose, share one's discoveries with its peers and the rest of the
world. We invite you to keep these values alive with Association Sans Nom
through workshops, conferences and other internal and public activities, as
well as the management of services by and for the members themselves.
